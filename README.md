###Compact Cori

Currently, the installation of Compact Cori at CRT requires that two scripts be
run to start the simulation.  One of the nodes (`CompactCori16`) is currently
being used as the visualization node (running Ubuntu instead of Debian).

To run the simulation:
1. Ensure the simulation is running on the master node (`CompactCori1`).  If
   not, use `run_md_simulation.  The LEDs should begin flashing with each
   timestep when the simulation is running.
2. Start the visualization server on the visualization node.  Run the script on
   the desktop to start the visualization server.
3. Point a Firefox to `localhost:8081` to view the simulation
